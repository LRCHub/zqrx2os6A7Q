[00:05.42] Lock broken
[00:06.84] Slur spoken
[00:08.31] Wound open
[00:09.48] Game token
[00:10.92] I didn't know you were keeping count
[00:16.53] Rain soaking
[00:17.64] Blind hoping
[00:19.08] You said I was
[00:20.56] Freeloading
[00:21.89] I didn't know you were keeping count
[00:39.89] 
[00:27.64] High infidelity
[00:30.19] Put on your records
[00:31.17] And regret me
[00:32.68] I bent the truth too far tonight
[00:35.19] I was dancing around
[00:36.61] Dancing around it
[00:38.63] High infidelity
[00:40.98] Put on your headphones
[00:41.56] And burn my city
[00:43.56] Your picket fence is sharp as knives
[00:46.01] I was dancing around
[00:47.25] Dancing around it
[00:55.75] 
[00:50.82] Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
[00:56.47] Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?
[01:24.97] 
[01:01.21] Storm coming
[01:02.25] Good husband
[01:04.08] Bad omen
[01:05.43] Dragged my feet right down the aisle
[01:10.49] At the house lonely
[01:11.65] Good money
[01:13.56] I'd pay if you'd just know me
[01:16.21] Seemed like the right thing at the time
[01:35.71] 
[01:23.38] You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
[01:29.17] The slowest way is never loving them enough
[01:34.49] Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
[01:39.91] Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life?
[02:09.91] 
[01:44.00] High infidelity
[01:46.42] Put on your records and regret me
[01:49.29] I bent the truth too far tonight
[01:51.86] I was dancing around
[01:53.62] Dancing around it
[02:02.12] 
[01:54.73] High infidelity
[01:57.25] Put on your headphones and burn my city
[01:59.90] Your picket fence is sharp as knives
[02:02.61] I was dancing around, dancing around it
[02:22.11] 
[02:07.14] Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
[02:12.60] Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?
[02:18.04] You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
[02:23.82] The slowest way is never loving them enough
[02:45.32] 
[02:27.77] High infidelity
[02:30.01] Put on your records and regret meeting me
[02:32.64] I bent the truth too far tonight
[02:35.12] I was dancing around
[02:36.44] Dancing around it
[02:44.94] 
[02:38.51] High infidelity
[02:40.94] Put on your headphones and burn my city
[02:43.68] Your picket fence is sharp as knives
[02:45.80] I was dancing around
[02:47.48] Dancing around it
[02:55.98] 
[03:12.68] Oh, there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
[03:18.15] And it's never enough, it's never enough
