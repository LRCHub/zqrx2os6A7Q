Spent all day working out in the weeds
Over my head in the mustard seeds
Oh, how it goes over my head
Twelve feet high over my head

Well, i try to keep the weakness from my poetry
But it sneaks back in just like a honeybee
Oh, how it goes over my head
Twelve feet high over my head

Oh, and Darling, I've been thinking
Oh, and Darling, I've been drinking
I've been sinking low
I thought you should know

Spent all night staring up at shooting stars
Didn't even notice they were only cars
Oh, 'cause it goes over my head
Twelve feet high over my head

Oh, and Darling, I've been frowning
Oh, and Darling, I've been drowning
Drowning all of my sorrows
In our lost tomorrows

When the honey's down
Oh, it's down at the backbreaking bottom
Well you should know
You got to smoke 'em if you want 'em
Smoke 'em if you got 'em

Oh, and Darling, I've been thinking
Oh, and Darling, I've been drinking
I've been sinking low
I thought you should know

I've been sinking low
I thought you should know
I thought you should know
You should know, little darling
Darling
