[00:05.95] We didn't know the times were lean
[00:19.93] Round our house the grass was green
[00:23.15] It didn't seem like things were all that bad
[00:25.84] I bet we walked a thousand miles
[00:30.31] Choppin' cotton and pushin' plows
[00:33.36] And learnin' how to give it all we had
[00:36.97] As life went on and years went by
[00:41.02] I saw the light in daddy's eye
[00:43.98] And felt the love in mamma's hands
[00:48.76] They kep us warm and kep us fed
[00:51.52] Taught us how to look ahead
[00:54.23] Now lookin' back I understand
[00:58.01] We were walkin' in high cotton
[01:01.57] Old times there are not forgotten
[01:04.29] Those fertile fields are never far away
[01:08.29] We were walkin' in high cotton
[01:12.19] Old times there are not forgotten
[01:14.72] Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced
[01:38.72] 
[01:18.83] When Sunday mornin's rolled around
[01:31.48] We dressed up in hand-me-downs
[01:34.05] Just in time to gather with the church
[01:37.34] Sometimes I think how long it's been
[01:42.60] And how it impressed me then
[01:44.70] It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work
[01:48.22] We were walkin' in high cotton
[01:52.28] Old times there are not forgotten
[01:54.55] Those fertile fields are never far away
[01:58.62] We were walkin' in high cotton
[02:02.61] Old time there are not forgotten
[02:05.13] Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced
[02:09.40] We were walkin' in high cotton
[02:13.37] Old times there are not forgotten
[02:15.66] Those fertile fields are never far away
[02:19.55] We were walkin' in high cotton
[02:23.51] Old times there are not forgotten
[02:26.06] Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced
[02:30.01] We were walkin' in high cotton
[02:33.58] Old times there are not forgotten
[02:36.37] Those fertile fields are never far away
[02:41.18] We were walkin' in high cotton
[02:44.45] Old time there are not forgotten
[02:47.18] Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced
[02:52.83] Walkin' in high cotton
