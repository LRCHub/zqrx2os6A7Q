High
What mood is that you wear this
time
Why do you get high
To change the seat your in
In time you won't come back
again
What mood is that you wear this
time
Why do you get high
To change the seat your in
In time you won't come back
again
High
High
High
High
High
High
Make light of the weight
Time off from hell
I could be in
These are the words you say
What mood is that you wear this
time
Why do you get high to change
the seat and complicate things
High (x6)
What does it take to get you
high
What will it take to get me high
What does it take to get us high
Whatever it takes to get you
high
High
High
You don't like me when i'm high
High
